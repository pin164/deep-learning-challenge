# deep-learning-challenge
Create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
# 
**brief description of the project**
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.  (Supervised learning because we are predicting y)
From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, provided a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 

**summary of approach:**<br>
The approach followed the instructions in the file Instructions depp-learning-challenge.docx<br>
>Step 1: Preprocess the Data<br>
>Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model<br>
Step 3: Optimize the Model<br>
Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model<br>
